# Suggest It

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind "Suggest It" comes from our personal experiences as international students. We understand the myriad of questions and challenges that students face when studying abroad. Our continuous search for solutions and the need to provide a one-stop solution to fellow students motivated us to embark on this project.

## What it does

"Suggest It" is a comprehensive platform designed to assist students planning to study abroad. Upon signing up and authenticating, users can select their desired country and university. The platform then offers a curated list of common questions that international students typically have. These questions are dynamically answered by ChatGPT, powered by OpenAI's API. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the answers, users can upvote the responses provided by ChatGPT. The voting system is carefully designed to prevent dummy votes, allowing for a fair and authentic feedback mechanism.

## How we built it

We built "Suggest It" by combining several technologies and methodologies:

- **User Authentication**: We implemented a user-friendly signup and authentication process to secure user data.

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: We used OpenAI's API to dynamically generate responses to common questions posed by international students.

- **Voting System**: We designed a user-friendly voting system that restricts users to a single vote, preventing the misuse of the platform.

- **Database Management**: Efficient data handling and database management were essential. We created a database structure with primary IDs to store and retrieve user interactions and suggestions.

## Challenges we ran into

Building "Suggest It" was not without its challenges:

- **Anti-Dummy Voting**: Implementing a robust system to prevent users from submitting multiple votes required careful planning and security measures.

- **Dynamic Suggestions**: Creating a system that dynamically generates relevant suggestions in real-time was technically demanding and required extensive brainstorming.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We take pride in the following achievements:

- **Problem Solving**: We learned the importance of persistence in problem-solving and never giving up until we found solutions.

- **Teamwork and Motivation**: Our collaborative teamwork and mutual support motivated us to reach our goals together.

- **Data Handling Expertise**: We gained valuable experience in data handling and database management, essential skills for any tech project.

## What we learned

Through this project, we learned invaluable lessons, including:

- **Persistence**: The importance of persistence in tackling complex problems.

- **Teamwork**: The significance of working as a team, which can be highly motivating.

- **Data Management**: Improved skills in data handling and efficient database management.

## What's next for Suggest It

We have exciting plans for the future of "Suggest It"! In the coming months, we aim to extend the platform with additional features and enhancements. Some of our plans include:

- **Expanding Coverage**: Adding support for more countries and universities to cater to a broader audience of international students.

- **User-Generated Content**: Allowing users to contribute their experiences and advice, making the platform more dynamic and user-driven.

- **Community Building**: Developing a sense of community among international students, enabling them to connect and share their insights.

- **Mobile App**: Creating a mobile app version for greater accessibility and convenience.

We are enthusiastic about the potential of "Suggest It" to positively impact the lives of international students, and we look forward to its continued growth and improvement.
